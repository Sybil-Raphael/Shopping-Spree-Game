# Shopping Spree Game 

**Name**: Sybil Raphael
**Due Date**: April 29, 2024

## Description

This repository contains the C++ source code for a "Shopping Spree" game.  This is a text-based game where a player interacts with a virtual shopping environment. The player can acquire items, which affect their tokens and points. The game includes different types of items, such as normal items, power-ups, and debuffs. The player's health, tokens, and points are tracked during the game.

## How to Run

To compile and run the game, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

1.  **Compile the source code:**

    ```bash
    g++ *.cpp -o shopping_spree
    ```

    This command compiles all the `.cpp` files and creates an executable named `shopping_spree`.  You might need to adjust the command based on your compiler and system.  If you are using a makefile, you can use the `make` command.
2.  **Run the game:**

    ```bash
    ./shopping_spree
    ```
